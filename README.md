# CryptoConductor

## Summary
CryptoConductor eases significant logistical strain for distributed user organizations that need to analyze, score, and aggregate data concerning various projects, companies, and organizations. Long gone are the days of dispersed and disorganized Google spreadsheets, lost Google Docs, disorganized work distribution tasks, inefficient specialist input gathering, and non-existent intelligence and insight functionalities. CryptoConductor serves as a means for small, domain specific professionals to coordinate across intellectual domains such that a robust and accurate analysis can be made for any entity in question. Whether the analysis concern a new software company startup, a cutting edge technical invention, or a cross-disciplinary research project, CryptoConductor can help coordinate specialist scoring and notes to create a simple and efficient output score for any exiting or continuing project.

CryptoConductor features specialist profiles for each member of your team. Each profile is given role-based domain-specific access for scoring and input based in the specialist discipline. Pulling disciplines and specialists together, CryptoConductor uses Projects to allow your team to create a unique project that coordinates all specialist input by domain and allows for customizeable weighting for the final output score. This allows every project to be correctly scoped for pertinent domains.
