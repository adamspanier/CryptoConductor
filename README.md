# CryptoConductor

## Summary
CryptoConductor eases logistical strain for distributed user organizations that neeed to analyze, score, and aggregate data concerning various projects, compaies, and organizations. Long gone are the days of dispersed and disorganized Google spreadsheets, lost Google Docs, disorganized work distribution, inefficent specialist input gathering, and no-existant intelligence and insight fucntionalities. CryptoConductor serves as a means for small, domain speicific professionals to coordinate across intellectual domains such that a robust and accurate analysis can be made for any entity in question. Whether the analysis concern a new software company startup, a cutting edge technical invention, or a cross-disciplianry reasearch project, CryptoConductor can help coordinate speicialist scoring and notes to create a simple and efficient output score for any exiting or continuing project.

CryptoConudcter features specialist profiles for each member of your team. Each profile is given role-based domain-specific access for scoring and input based in the specialist discipline. Pulling disciplines and specialists together, CryptoConductre uses Projects to allow your team to create a unique project that coordinates all specialist input by domain and allows for customizeable weighting for the final output score. This allows every project to be correctly scoped for pertinent domains.
