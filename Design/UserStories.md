# User Stories

### Overview

_User stories_ help elicit the requirements of any software design more completely. While many use cases can be perceived through the intended functionality of a given system, more subtle use cases can be missed without intentional probing. The _user stories_ in this document help communicate the expectations users require when using the CryptoConductor platform.


### Users

1. Specialists
2. Leaders
3. Clients
4. Associates

#### Specialists

Specialists comprise any user that will add numerical or text data in relation to any project in the system. Specialists are given a specialty, and can only submit information relating directly to that specialty. If a cybersecurity expert is involved in grading a software system, they would be given a _cybersecurity_ specialty and allowed to submit information relating only to the Software Assurance portion of the grading scale.

#### Leaders

Leaders can also be Specialists, but are given the added ability to create new analysis projects. When a new company or product needs to be added to the system for grading, a Leader is required to both create the project, but also be accountable for it's progress, operation, and behaviors.

#### Clients

Clients are any entity that originate from any project in the system. This could be a CEO of a company requesting scoring checking scoring progress, it could be a programmer that needs software analyzed checking on specialist notes, or it could be a researcher in a research project looking at the progress of the project.

#### Associates

Associates are any entity that does not have any vested interest in the system. This comprises all non-Specialist, non-Leader, and non-Client operators. Associates maintain the lowest level of access privileges.
